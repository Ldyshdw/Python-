This part is a brief summary about the whole lesson I have taken from 2024/2/25 to 2024/6/21 folling Pro Yan.  
Firstly I have to commit that I at present is not so good at computering with lacking of exercise. To be honst, I NEARLY spent all my in wet experiment in lab. I trully think learning a language especially Python is important for me and my future work. Even though I didnot score high as the top students in this semester, I believe I will devote to it.  
Secondly This part mainly contain two parts.  
1. Study materials in the semester  
2. Cheating papers for the exams  
Hope you enjoy it.
